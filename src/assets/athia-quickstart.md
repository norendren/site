# ATHIA RPG - Character Creation Quick Guide

## Creation Order

### 1. RACE & CLASS
Choose your character's race and class first - these determine most other stats.

### 2. ATTRIBUTES (6 Core Stats: -3 to +3)
- **CON** (Constitution): Health, stamina, toughness
- **DEX** (Dexterity): Agility, coordination, defense
- **INS** (Instinct): Perception, intuition, divine magic
- **KNO** (Knowledge): Intelligence, academics, extra talent points
- **STR** (Strength): Physical power, arcane magic, damage
- **VAL** (Valor): Courage, leadership, daring

**Starting Pool:** GM assigns total points (0 = Commoners, 2 = Young Heroes, 4 = Heroes)
Distribute points across all 6 attributes within -3 to +3 range.

### 3. RACIAL PERKS
Select 2 racial perks from your race's list. Note any bonuses.

### 4. ABILITIES
Choose abilities based on your class (from class list + general abilities).

### 5. TALENTS (18 Skills)
Spend talent points (from class + KNO modifier) on the 18 talents.
- **1-2 points** = Apprentice
- **3-5 points** = Journeyman
- **6 points** = Master
- **0 points** = Untrained (roll at Disadvantage)

### 6. ASPECTS (Derived Stats)
Calculate from attributes, class, and choices:
- **Health** (4 tiers): Fatigued → Battered → Injured → Down
- **Defense** = Armor + DEX (up to armor max) + bonuses
- **Daring** = VAL + bonuses (vs Fear in combat)
- **Stamina** = Class base + CON + bonuses (for combat actions)
- **Speed** = 20 feet base

### 7. MAGIC (If Applicable)

**Arcane (Mana-based):**
- **Mana** = Class base + STR + bonuses
- **Aptitude** = Spend points across 5 Arts (Air/Cosmos/Earth/Fire/Water)
- Design your spells

**Divine (Favor-based):**
- **Favor** = Class base + INS + bonuses
- Select Influence(s) from class
- Design your interventions

### 8. EQUIPMENT
Start with **75 silver Septems**. Buy armor, weapons, and gear.
*Note: Armor affects max DEX bonus and stamina.*

### 9. ATTACKS & DAMAGE
Record Hit Check bonus and damage for each weapon:
- **Hit Check** = d20 + DEX (+ class bonuses)
- **Damage** = Weapon damage + STR damage (for melee/hurled)

### 10. FINAL TOUCHES
- Choose a House
- Select a Faith (if applicable)
- Determine age
- Note special features (Blesses, grimoire pages, specialties, combat style)
- **Name your character!**

## Key Formulas

```
Attribute Check = d20 + Attribute Score
Talent Score = Talent Points + Attribute Modifier + Bonuses
Talent Check = d20 + Talent Score

Health (each tier) = Class base + Racial bonus + CON + Ability bonuses
Defense = Armor value + DEX (limited by armor) + bonuses
Stamina = Class base + CON + bonuses
Mana = Class base + STR + bonuses (Arcane casters)
Favor = Class base + INS + bonuses (Divine casters)
```

## Difficulty Targets
- **Easy:** 9
- **Average:** 12
- **Difficult:** 15
- **Extreme:** 18

## Advantage/Disadvantage
- **Advantage:** Roll 2d20, take higher
- **Disadvantage:** Roll 2d20, take lower
