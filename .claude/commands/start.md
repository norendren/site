Please read the following context files to understand the project:

1. `.context/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` - Main project overview, current status, architecture, design system, and key decisions
2. `.context/CHARACTER_DATA_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Data structure design and implementation approach
3. `.context/PDF_COORDINATE_TRACKING.md` - PDF field coordinate mappings
4. `.context/ATHIA_RACES_CLASSES.md` - Game content reference for races and classes

After reading these files, provide a brief summary of:
- Current project status and what's working
- What we're currently working on
- The tech stack and key architecture decisions

Then ask how you can help.
