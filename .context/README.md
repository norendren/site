# Project Context Documentation

This folder contains all project documentation used by Claude Code to understand the project state, architecture, and implementation history.

## Quick Start for New Sessions

To load context at the start of a session, use:
```
/start
```

This slash command (defined in `.claude/commands/start.md`) will automatically read all relevant context files.

## File Organization Philosophy

### What Goes Where

**PROJECT_CONTEXT.md** should contain:
- High-level overview and current status
- Architectural decisions and rationale
- Design system and styling guidelines
- File structure and key locations
- Updated whenever major features are added

**IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md** should contain:
- Detailed implementation notes for specific features
- Technical details and code examples
- Integration steps and verification
- Chronological record of changes
- Updated after completing each major feature

**Reference files** should contain:
- Static game content and rules
- Coordinate mappings
- Architecture guidance
- Updated only when game rules change or coordinates are adjusted

---

## Maintenance Guidelines

### When Adding New Features

1. **During Implementation**:
   - Track progress with TodoWrite tool
   - Make notes about decisions and challenges

2. **After Completing a Feature**:
   - Add detailed entry to **IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md** (top of file, newest first)
   - Update "Current Status" section in **PROJECT_CONTEXT.md**
   - Move completed items from "What's Next" to "Recently Completed"
   - Update "Last Updated" date and focus statement
   - Update Key Files Map if new files were added

3. **When Making Architectural Decisions**:
   - Add to "Key Decisions Made" section in **PROJECT_CONTEXT.md**
   - Explain the decision, why it was made, and trade-offs
   - Include examples if helpful

4. **When Adjusting PDF Coordinates**:
   - Update **PDF_COORDINATE_TRACKING.md** with verified positions
   - Mark fields as âœ“ Verified or âš  Needs adjustment

## For Claude Code

These files provide context about:
- âœ… Current project status and what's working
- âœ… Tech stack and architecture decisions
- âœ… Design system and styling guidelines (WCAG AA compliance)
- âœ… Game rules and content structure
- âœ… Where to find key files and functions
- âœ… Implementation history and lessons learned
- âœ… What's next on the roadmap

The `/start` command references these files for quick onboarding.
