# Abilities Data Population Progress

## Current Status
✅ **All 300 abilities have descriptions populated!**
✅ **Acolyte abilities (60) have `effect` fields and `hasMechanicalEffect` flags!**

Working on adding `effect` fields to remaining classes in `/home/dylan/dev/site/src/data/abilities.ts`

## Phase 1: Description Population - ✅ COMPLETE
1. ✅ `ability_titles.pdf` - Extracted all 300 ability names and organized by class
2. ✅ `ability_description_1.pdf` - Populated ~21 abilities (Acolyte abilities from first batch)
3. ✅ `ability_description_2.pdf` - Populated ~50 abilities (multiple classes)
4. ✅ `ability_description_3.pdf` - Populated ~65 abilities
5. ✅ `ability_description_remaining.pdf` - Populated remaining ~164 abilities

**Result:** All 300 abilities now have complete `description` fields! ✅

## Phase 2: Effect Fields - IN PROGRESS
