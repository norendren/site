## Next Steps
üìç **CONTINUE HERE:** Process `/home/dylan/dev/site/src/assets/pdfs/ability_description_remaining.pdf`

This PDF contains the remaining ability descriptions that need to be populated.

## Progress Summary
- **Total Abilities:** 300
- **Populated So Far:** ~136 (45% complete)
- **Remaining:** ~164 abilities to populate from `ability_description_remaining.pdf`

## Approach
Continue the same pattern:
1. Read the PDF
2. Extract descriptions verbatim
3. Populate the abilities data structure with:
   - `prerequisiteClass` (if class-specific)
   - `prerequisiteAbilities` (if ability prerequisites exist)
   - `description` (verbatim from PDF)
   - `restrictions` (for mutual exclusivity rules)
   - `canTakeMultiple` (if applicable)
4. Leave `effect` field empty for future batch processing

## Notes
- All descriptions are being copied verbatim from PDFs
- Process `effect` field in a separate batch later
- Keep originally extracted titles (e.g., "Battle Mage I" not "Battle Mage")
- Use inference for PDF typos
